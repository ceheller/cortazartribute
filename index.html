        <div id="tribute-info">
          Julio Cortazar was born in Brussels, Belgium; and died in a small town located in France. He spent the first years of his life living in
          the city of Banfield, which back then was a very small town located some twenty kilometers away from the city of Buenos Aires, in Argentina, South America.
          His famous novel "Rayuela" is considered to be a disruptive and unique piece of art in the world of literature. He is considered one of the most
          important authors that was a part of the "Latin American Boom" during the sixties and the seventies. It is said that he left Argentina because
          of his discontent with Peron's government, and he spent the rest of life in France. In fact, and though his works are written in Spanish with a
          notorious and important influence from Argentina's culture, his most important works were written in France.
